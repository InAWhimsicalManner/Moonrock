This is a search engine / aggregator for game sites. You may search with text and tags. If the game site has a built-in search feature it will use that, or else it would use our own index and crawler. If the query is a url, it will just function like a normal web proxy. NSFW games (Newgrounds) will be marked accordingly. If duplicates are found, there will be a mirror button on the results, so you can choose which games that you want to proxy. Speaking proxies, the links are not opened and external site however they are placed inside the site's internal player there are automatic proxy game scraping. This is done without any iframing! Any bookmarked game will be available offline (Unless tagged as offline) just like the rest of the site, despite the search functionality. This essentially gives you all games in one site, available offline, and more importantly Moonrock is free from legal issues unlike the other game sites by proxy networks.
